#+title: Static Site Generators

* What's a static site?
+ No backend processing
+ No database involved
+ Visitors are served the same HTML file from a server

* Static Site Generators
+ https://jamstack.org/generators/

* Host your own static website!
+ Use GitHub pages to share your creation to the world
